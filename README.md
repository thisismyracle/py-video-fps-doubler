doubles your video fps, using average function

yea its basically insert new frame from (current frame + next frame) / 2.

i tested with 45s Full HD 60fps video, it was throttling (13-14GB RAM, 100-200MBPS disk) in several minutes xD
after that i got 45s Full HD 120fps video owo

a new experience ahaha

--try this at ur own risk xD, i recommend you to use Google Colab--
