doubles your video fps, using average function

yea its basically insert new frame from (current frame + next frame) / 2.

i tested with 45s Full HD 60fps video, it was throttling (13-14GB RAM, 100-200MBPS disk) in several minutes xD
after that i got 45s Full HD 120fps video, but still no audio owo

you can see the samples here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XpfNyoNzpVJIE7HMdAIRrtpStIVy0rMN?usp=sharing

a new experience ahaha, inspired from MEMC technology in television, so i tried the most simple way xD

--try this at ur own risk xD, i recommend you to use Google Colab--
